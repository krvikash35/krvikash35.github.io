        <blockquote>Transition allow us to control how fast or smooth an css property of an element will change.
        Transformation allow us to change the physical properties(size, shape etc) of element.
        Animation are like superset of transition, it provides ability to change the style of an element with multiple state, whereas transition only
        control how fast or smooth the sytle will change with two state(start and end).</blockquote>

 <span class="text-accent">transition-timing-function</span> controls how fast or slow these transition will run. there are various pre-defined 
 function.<span class="text-accent"> transition-delay</span> will delay the start of transition from actual start.
